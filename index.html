        <p>I've been planning this for a while now.  A little bit about me....  I have been a supermarket refrigeration tech for about 5 years in DFW.  Before that, I was a residential HVAC and plumber helper for about a year.  I also started to learn computer programming about 4 years ago.  This will start as a blog, and soon turn into an entire community for people who work in skilled trades.  For now, I will keep my email at the top of the page for you to email pics to.  I will post them here for you.<hr><hr> </p>

        <p>So there I was, pretty normal day, chillin in my van after running a few easy calls, when my service manager calls, which is rare.  He tells me to go to this store in Fort Worth.  They're A/C was out.  I showed up and could tell right away that this thing hasn't been running right for a long time, not even running at all for at least a few months.  I called him and let him know that it would take some real work to get this thing going right.  He said "get it running, at least half ass, I don't care what you have to do. We are installing an entire new system in a month anyway".  Okay.... that's what I do best.  I rigged this thing up so bad.  I wont even go into detail what I did because I don't want people to yell at me.  But sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>
